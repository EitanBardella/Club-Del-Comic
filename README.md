  Credit Card Identification Numbers (BIN) are the first six digits of a credit card. These digits identify the card issuer and its type. For example, Visa card numbers start with 4, Mastercard with 5, American Express with 3, and Discover with 6. These are just a few     examples. You can use this information to identify and validate card types in your application or service.
  This are some credit card numbers that you can copy and prove those:
  - Visa: 4111 1111 1111 1111
  - Mastercard: 5555 5555 5555 4444
